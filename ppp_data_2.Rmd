## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
mykey <- scan("./censusapikey.txt", what=character())
census_api_key(mykey, install=TRUE, overwrite=TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This section is for the analysis

```{r}

# Then we might want to break that up by NAICS code
all_loans <- all_loans %>% 
  left_join(naics_codes)

# Get a count by Approval amount. We are looking for the sweet spot for maximum amount associated with a single-person business,
# which is around $20,833
# This counts by NAICS code the loans that hover around the single person sweet spot
max1personalLoan <- all_loans %>% 
  filter((CurrentApprovalAmount >=20830) & (CurrentApprovalAmount <=20835)) %>%

Here we explore the issues with undisbursed loans to individual applicants (businesses with 1 saved job)
and then undisbursed loans to individual applicants with high salary ($100,000)

```{r}
# Summarize information about undisbursed loans by Originating Lender
all_single_loans_summary <- all_loans %>% 
  filter(JobsReported == 1) %>%
  mutate(UndisbursedAmount = replace_na(UndisbursedAmount, 0)) %>%
  mutate(CurrentApprovalAmount = replace_na(CurrentApprovalAmount, 0)) %>%
  group_by(OriginatingLender) %>%
  summarise(totalUndisbursed = sum(UndisbursedAmount), totalApproved = sum(CurrentApprovalAmount), count = n() ) %>%
  mutate(pctUndisbursed = totalUndisbursed/totalApproved) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Grab the undisbursed loans to applicants listing only a single job reported as being supported
# where the status date is before 45 days from the time the data was published (06/30/2021). This might account
# for loans that are still in process

all_single_undisbursed_loans <- all_loans %>% 
  filter(UndisbursedAmount != 0) %>%
  filter(JobsReported == 1) %>%
  filter(mdy(LoanStatusDate) <= mdy("05/15/2021") )

# Summarize by Originating Lender
all_sdls_summary_by_lender <- all_single_undisbursed_loans %>%

# Note the predominance of certain types of businesses (barber shops and beauty salons!)

# Get the 5 digit zip

all_single_undisbursed_loans <- all_single_undisbursed_loans %>%
  mutate(zip5 = str_sub(BorrowerZip, 1, 5))

# Summarize by ZIP code
all_sdls_summary_by_zip5 <- all_single_undisbursed_loans %>%
  group_by(zip5) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# All single disbursed loans

all_single_disbursed_loans <- all_loans %>%

  filter(JobsReported == 1)

# Summarize by undisbursed amount and by count of loans

  arrange(desc(count))
 
 
 # ALl loans to individuals (sole proprietors, individual S Corps/LLCs, etc.)
all_single_loans <- all_loans %>% 
  filter(JobsReported == 1) 

# Group by location - looking for patterns
  
gbcols = c("BorrowerAddress", "BorrowerCity", "BorrowerZip")
all_single_loans %>%
  group_by(across(all_of(gbcols))) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(CurrentApprovalAmount), count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
 
# Maybe look at zip codes and get their racial populations??
# Can we get an aggregation of count of loans in Zip Codes where the black population is greater than X%
#
```

THis is legacy code, maybe delete

```{r}
single_beauty_salons <- all_loans %>% 
  filter(NAICSCode == "812112") %>% 
  filter(JobsReported == 1) %>%
  filter((CurrentApprovalAmount >=20830) & (CurrentApprovalAmount <=20835)) 

single_beauty_salons %>%
  filter(UndisbursedAmount != 0) %>%
  group_by(OriginatingLender) %>%
  #summarise(count = n()) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(UndisbursedAmount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

# Single beauty salons that have undisbursed funds with Capital Plus Financial as the Originating Lender
sbs_undisbursed_cpf <- single_beauty_salons %>%
  filter(UndisbursedAmount != 0) %>%
  filter(OriginatingLender == "Capital Plus Financial, LLC")

gbcols <- c("Race", "Gender")

# Undisbursed loans by race and gender
sbs_undisbursed_cpf %>%
  group_by(across(all_of(gbcols))) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Can we group by address?
ppp_by_address <- all_loans %>%
  group_by(BorrowerAddress, BorrowerCity) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

ppp_by_address %>% head(100)

```

Next chunk of code - all loan applications from 1445 Woodmont Ln
```{r}
physical_address_dot_com <- all_loans %>%
  filter(str_detect(BorrowerAddress, "1445 Woodmont Ln NW"))

murray  <- all_loans %>%
  filter(str_detect(BorrowerAddress, "5544 S Green Street 0.0"))

uber  <- all_loans %>%
  filter(str_detect(BorrowerAddress, "1455 Market St Ste 400"))
```
